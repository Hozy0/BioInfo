**Local Alignment Problem:** Find the highest-scoring [[Local Aligment|local alignment]] between two strings.
- **Input:** Strings $v$ and $w$ as well as a [[Scoring Matrix|matrix]] ***score***.
- **Output:** Substrings of $v$ and $w$ whose [[Global Alignment|global alignment]] (as defined by the matrix ***score***) is maximal among all global alignments of all substrings of $v$ and $w$.
