A log odds matrix is the logarithmic form of the relatedness odds matrix.
The formula to compute it is: $$ S_{ij}=10 \log(M_{ij}/f_{j})$$
Where:
- $S_{ij}$ is the score for aligning any two residues in a pairwise alignment.
- $M_{ij}$ is of the observed frequency of substitutions for each pair of amino acids.
- $f_{i}$ is the probability of amino acid residue $i$ occurring in the second sequence by chance.
